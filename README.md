# Sailboat Gym Environment

I ran this mainly using Windows 10. When I ran it on Ubuntu 19.3 it kept having issues. It may be possible to make it work, but I could never get it to run properly.


## Packages to install

`pip install pandas`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install gym`

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install keras`

I'm not sure if you need this as well but I always run it.

`pip install keras.rl`

`pip install tensorflow`

Hopefully that was everything.

## Running the training

Now to run it. From the main directory run.

`cd sailboat`

`python regression.py`
